* **Burndown Chart:** This visual tool tracks the **actual effort expended** against the **ideal rate of 4.75 points/day**, clearly validating the project's ability to meet the planned 4-day deadline.
* **User Stories:** All high-value tasks were formally defined, estimated with **Story Points**, and clearly mapped to team members for accountability across the sprints.
