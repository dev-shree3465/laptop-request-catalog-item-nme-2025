## ðŸ’» ServiceNow Laptop Request Automation Project

This repository documents the complete lifecycleâ€”from **ideation** to **deployment**â€”of a dynamic **ServiceNow Catalog Item** designed to automate and streamline the employee laptop request process.

Our core mission was to replace a slow, manual, and non-dynamic system with a fast, modern, and user-friendly experience.
