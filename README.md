## 📘 Project Overview

This initiative focuses on deploying a **dynamic Service Catalog Item** within the **ServiceNow** platform. The core goal is to **modernize and automate** the existing, time-consuming manual workflow for requesting work laptops within an organization. The resulting solution provides a **fast, guided digital experience**, significantly improving data accuracy and establishing a robust governance structure for deployment.

This solution was developed through the **SmartInternz NME program** in collaboration with **ServiceNow** and **SmartBridge**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Employees require an efficient, rapid process for securing essential work equipment. The existing manual procedure frequently led to **delays, confusion, and inaccurate data capture** because it lacked dynamic form behavior and clear user guidance.

The objective was to create a Catalog Item that provides:
1.  **Unified Digital Intake:** A single, centralized point for all submission requests.
2.  **Guided User Experience:** Dynamic field changes and contextual instructions to simplify the user journey.
3.  **Enhanced Usability:** Inclusion of a form reset capability to improve the overall user experience (UX).
4.  **Configuration Integrity:** Ensuring all changes are meticulously recorded for secure deployment and robust governance.

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps

The following steps detail the required configuration sequence to successfully deploy this automated solution within a ServiceNow instance:

### Step 1: Governance Setup
* A **Local Update Set** named **"Laptop Request"** was created and activated to systematically track all configuration changes.

### Step 2: Service Catalog Item Creation
* The primary catalog item, **Laptop Request**, was created.
* It was correctly organized under the **Service Catalog** and the **Hardware** category.

### Step 3: Variables Definition

The following variables were defined to capture request data:

| Variable Name | Type | Technical Name |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Laptop Model | Single Line Text | `laptop_model` |
| Justification | Multi Line Text | `justification` |
| Additional Accessories | Checkbox | `additional_accessories` |
| Accessories Details | Multi Line Text | `accessories_details` |

### Step 4: Dynamic Behavior Implementation
* A **Catalog UI Policy** (*Show Accessories Details*) was implemented to control field visibility.
* **Condition:** The `accessories_details` field is displayed when `additional_accessories` is set to `true`.
* **Action:** The policy ensures that `accessories_details` is set to **Visible: True** and is **Mandatory: True** under this condition.

### Step 5: User Experience Action
* A **Client UI Action** titled **"Reset Form"** was created to enhance UX.
* **Table:** Configured on the `sc_cart` table.
* **Script:** Utilizes the `g_form.clearForm()` function to clear all fields, preceded by an alert for user confirmation.

### Step 6: Deployment & Migration
* The Update Set was completed (**Marked Complete**) and then **Exported to XML**.
* The exported XML was subsequently Imported, Previewed, and **Committed** in the target production or test environment.
